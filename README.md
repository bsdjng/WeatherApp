## Why I made these choices

- **Backend**: I chose PHP with Laravel because it is the framework I am most familiar with. Laravel provides a structured, clean way to build web applications quickly, which made it ideal for this diagnostic project.

- **Frontend**: I used Tailwind CSS because it allows me to rapidly style components without leaving the HTML, keeping the frontend clean and maintainable. Tailwindâ€™s utility-first approach made it easy to implement responsive designs quickly.

- **Data storage**: Weather data is cached for **1 hour**.

## Future Improvements

- **Database for weather data**: Currently, I use caching for 1 hour to reduce local API requests. In the future, a database could be added to store weather data permanently. This would allow the app to minimize the number of API requests further, especially given the small API rate limit (25 requests per hour), while still providing historical weather data for users.
